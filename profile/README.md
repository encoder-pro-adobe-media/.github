# Media Encoder
Adobe Media Encoder is a media processing and encoding tool developed by Adobe. It‚Äôs used to convert (transcode), compress, and export audio and video files into various formats optimized for playback, broadcast, or streaming.

It's especially useful for creators who work in Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Audition, as it allows background exporting, freeing up your main apps for continued editing.
